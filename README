Chats chats chats

Things to do:
    - Pass and display a reason for deactivating a chat.
    - Assign users session_token via cookie
        -bring up error if they do not have cookies enabled
        -allow them to see website, but not to enter in topics
    - Stylize things so they don't look awful
    - Don't show the topic if the creater is currently chatting. 
        -likewise, check the status of the creater before pushing to chats
    - Maybe add a rating system, so if some one gets a lot of downvotes, they
        aren't allowed to chat for a set amount of time. (IP based.)
